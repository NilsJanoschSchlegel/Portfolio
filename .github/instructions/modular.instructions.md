The Modular design pattern is a software design approach that separates a program into distinct, independent modules, each responsible for a specific functionality. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.
Each module can be developed, tested, and debugged independently, allowing for easier collaboration among developers and more efficient problem-solving. Modular design also facilitates easier updates and modifications to the codebase, as changes can be made to individual modules without affecting the entire system.
When implementing modular design, it is essential to define clear interfaces between modules, ensuring that they can communicate effectively while remaining decoupled. This approach enhances the overall structure of the code, making it easier to understand and manage.
